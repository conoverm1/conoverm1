2023 Data Science Summer Experience

Worked with Xavier University's Office of Institutional Research to develop a profile of students who 
are retained from year to year. Data preparation/wrangling to make visualizations to present to the
provost office. The data itself that we were given is confidential but the code and graphs doesn't 
contain any identifying information.

City Council Re-Election Campaign Volunteering 

Worked with the US Census API through the tidycensus package to extract demographic information from
base and swing areas in Cincinnati. Had to combine census geometries with precinct geometries to make
a data set with demographic information about each precinct.
